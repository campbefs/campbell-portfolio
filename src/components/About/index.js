        I am a burgeoning full-stack web develop interested in mastering the latest tools and technologies.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My background is in operations and analytics. 
        I love working on the user experience aspect of products, and enjoy helping scale 
        products to the delight of a wide audience, leveraging data 
        to make better decisions.  But I love building getting my hands dirty with programming 
        just as much as optimizing existing products using data.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I am comfortable using HTML and CSS, and skilled in JavaScript, Python and SQL. I enjoy building 
        front-end products, as well as working on backend systems and data infrastructure.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My breadth of experience in technologies includes Rest APIs, ETL/data pipelines, Node.js, mongoDB (NoSQL), ORM, ODM, webpack,
        Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), Git, and React.
